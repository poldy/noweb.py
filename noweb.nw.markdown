The following literature is modified from the original version.  You
may see the original version either from previous version of this
file in Git (commit 81cd901a7377d0021f84f38b00afd633fe2009c2) or
[here](https://goo.gl/OMK80Y):

The modifications I made to this file are as follows:

  * Wrapping long line to have at most 72 characters per line.  And
    using 2 spaces after each period (.) instead of 1 space.  I like it
    this way personally.

  * To accomplish the above changes, I have to shorten long URL using
    Goo.gl (URL Shortener Service from Google).  The script I use to
    call Goo.gl is from:
    
      https://github.com/dragontortoise/google_shortener

  * Replacing the word "I" with the original author's name which is
    "JonathanAquino" so that I can use "I" to refer to myself.

  * Modifying and adding more information as I see appropriate.

  * Modifying Python code from Python 2 to Python 3.  This is done
    very easily as there was only 1 place to fix which is the print
    statement in Python 2 which is changed to be function in Python 3.

JonathanAquino has recently been interested in the old idea of 
[literate programming](https://goo.gl/mZ11) (full url: `http://en.wikipe
dia.org/wiki/Literate_programming`).

Basically, you have a document that describes in detail how a program
works, and it has embedded chunks of code. It allows you to see the
thoughts of the programmer as he explains how he writes the program
using prose. A tool is provided that you can use to extract the working
program from chunks of code in the document.

Here's the thing: *what you are reading right now is a literate
program*.

Yes, you can copy this blog post into a file and feed it into the tool,
and it will spit out a program.  Q: Where do I get the tool?  A: That's
the program that this document spits out.  This document will produce a
script that you can use to extract code from
[noweb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb)-format literate programs.

Why do we need to make a new tool if the
[noweb](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noweb) tool already exists? Because
the noweb tool is hard to install.  It's not super-hard, but most people
don't want to spend time trying to compile it from source.  There are
Windows binaries but you have to [get](https://goo.gl/QNkkqP)
(full url: `http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.literateprogramming.
com/noweb/nowebinstall.html`) them from the Wayback Machine.

Anyway, the noweb tool doesn't seem to do very much, so why not write a
little script to emulate it?

And that is what we will do now.

# DOWNLOAD

If you are just interested in the noweb.py script produced by this
document, you can download it from GitHub.

* The original version of noweb.py by JonathanAquino can be downloaded
  from [here](https://goo.gl/lT3W3M) (full url: `https://github.com/Jona
  thanAquino/noweb.py/raw/master/noweb.py`).

* Or my version of noweb.py which can be downloaded from
  [here](https://goo.gl/TohvYS) (full url: `https://github.com/dragontor
  toise/noweb.py/blob/master/noweb.py`).

# USAGE

(You may find a simpler version of how to run noweb.py in the readme
file [here](https://goo.gl/YwWupP) (full url:
https://github.com/dragontortoise/noweb.py/blob/master/readme.markdown).

The end goal is to produce a Python script that will take a literate
program as input (noweb format) and extract code from it as output.  For
example,

~~~
  noweb.py -Rhello.py hello.nw.markdown > hello.py
~~~

This will read in a file called hello.noweb and extract the code
labelled "hello.php".  We redirect the output into a hello.php file.

Or in our case, to generate noweb.py itself, it will be:

~~~
  noweb.py -Rnoweb.py noweb.nw.markdown > noweb.py
~~~

We don't need a tool to extract documentation out of the literate
source file as it is written in Markdown format so it is already a
documentation by itself.  Note that other noweb implementation usually
has a tool to generate documentation from the litrate source file.

From here on I will explain you how we can create noweb.py program.
Please see below a full pseudocode of what our program will look like.

Note that we need to import 2 modules which are sys and re.

* sys : to handle stdin and stdout
* re  : of course, we need to use regular expression!

Note again that I see this is the pros of literate programming.  We
can arrange the order  of codes in a human friendly way by showing
the top-view of the whole program first before we dig deep down into
each part.

In a literate program, there are named chunks of code interspersed
throughout the document.  Take the chunk of code below.  The name of it
is "noweb.py".  The chunk ends with an @ sign.  Note that
__begin=python__ and __end=python__ is a vim syntax hightlight code
I use which you can see details about it from here:

<<Function expand(): Recursively expanding the output chunk>>

<<Outputting the chunks>>
@
__end=python__
~~~

# PARSING THE COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS

First off, the program parses command-line arguments from stdin.

We need to know which chunk name the user has asked to extract.  In
other words, we need to parse the command-line arguments given to the
script:

~~~
  noweb.py -Rhello.py hello.nw.markdown
~~~

For simplicity, we'll assume that there are always two command-line
arguments: in this example, "-Rhello.py" and "hello.nw.markdown".  So
let's grab those.

* hello.py is `outputChunkName`.
* hello.nw.markdown is `filename`.

~~~
__begin=python__
<<Parsing the command-line arguments>>=
filename = sys.argv[-1]
outputChunkName = sys.argv[-2][2:]
@
__end=python__
~~~

# READING IN THE FILE

Let's read in the file given on the command line.  We'll build up a map
called "chunks", which will contain the chunk names and the lines of
each chunk.

~~~
__begin=python__
<<Reading in the file>>=
file = open(filename)
chunkName = None
chunks = {}
OPEN = "<<"
CLOSE = ">>"
for line in file:
  match = re.match(OPEN + "([^>]+)" + CLOSE + "=", line)
  if match:
    chunkName = match.group(1)
    # If chunkName exists in chunks, then we'll just add to the existing
    # chunk.
    if not chunkName in chunks:
      chunks[chunkName] = []
  else:
    match = re.match("^@$", line)
    if match:
      chunkName = None
    elif chunkName:
      chunks[chunkName].append(line)
@
__end=python__
~~~

# RECURSIVELY EXPANDING THE OUTPUT CHUNK

So far, so good.  Now we need a recursive function to expand any chunks
found in the output chunk requested by the user.  Take a deep breath.
We name the function `expand`.

~~~
__begin=python__
<<Function expand(): Recursively expanding the output chunk>>=
def expand(chunkName, indent):
  chunkLines = chunks[chunkName]
  expandedChunkLines = []
  for line in chunkLines:
    # Check if the line is another chunk or not.
    match = re.match("(\s*)" + OPEN + "([^>]+)" + CLOSE + "\s*$", \
      line)
    if match:
      # Expand the chunk and add the result which are multiple lines of
      # codes to expandedChunkLines.
      expandedChunkLines.extend(expand(match.group(2), indent + \
        match.group(1)))
    else:
      # Add a single line of code.
      expandedChunkLines.append(indent + line)
  return expandedChunkLines
@
__end=python__
~~~

# OUTPUTTING THE CHUNKS

The last step is easy.  We just call the recursive function and output
the result.

* `expand` is the recursive function I showed you above.
* `outputChunkName` is the first command-line argument with option -R.

~~~
__begin=python__
<<Outputting the chunks>>=
for line in expand(outputChunkName, ""):
  print(line, end="")
@
__end=python__
~~~

And we're done.  We now have a tool to extract code from a literate
programming document.  Try it on this blog post!

# APPENDIX I: GENERATING THE SCRIPT

To generate noweb.py from this document, you first need a tool to
extract the code from it. You can use the original
[noweb](https://goo.gl/ghNSXF) (full url: `http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/n
oweb/`) tool, but that's a bit cumbersome to install, so it's easier to
use the original Python script [noweb.py](https://goo.gl/lT3W3M)
(full url: `http://github.com/JonathanAquino/noweb.py/raw/master/noweb.
py`) or my version [noweb.py](https://goo.gl/WHjKAd)
(full url: https://github.com/dragontortoise/noweb.py)

Assuming you save this document into file noweb.nw.markdown .

Then you can generate noweb.py from noweb.nw.markdown as follows:

~~~
  noweb.py -Rnoweb.py noweb.nw.markdown > noweb.py
~~~
